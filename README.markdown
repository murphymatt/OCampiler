Matt Murphy -- OCampiler

This is a simple compiler build using ocaml. This compiler will work for a relatively simple lisp-style language. Currently all that it does is print out the input arguments.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Install Core

`opam install core`

Ensure that you have core version 0.10 installed.

Then, simply run make and let the makefile take care of everything
usage:  
`./ocampiler.native [-length] [-help] [ARGS]`
